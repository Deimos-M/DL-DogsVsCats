# DL-DogsVsCats
This repository consist of three different types of technique that can be used for image classification task by using very little amount of dataset. These models are developed in such a way that they can distinguish between images , in this particular case i made a binary image classifier to diffrentiate between images of cats and dogs. The techniques that are used here are :-

* 1st_convNet.ipynb :- Training a small network from scratch (as a baseline model).
* 2nd_convNet.ipynb :- Using the bottleneck features of a pre-trained network.
* 3rd_convNet.ipynb :- Fine-tuning the top layers of a pre-trained network.
